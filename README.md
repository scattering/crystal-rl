# Q Learning with Pycrysfml

This is a simple Q learning algorithm for use with pycrysfml. It trains a model on the data continated in prnio.ctl/prnio.int

## Setup

This code is designed to be run from:

     pycrysfml/hklgen/examples/sxtal/crystal-rl/sxtalQLearning.py
     pycrysfml/hklgen/examples/HOBK/simpleQAlg.py

simpleQAlg.py is a draft which was coverted to sxtalQLearning.py, it is not inteded to be functional.
